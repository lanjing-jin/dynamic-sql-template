# dynamic-sql-template
SQL Server dynamic SQL templating solution

This project enables you to write dynamic SQL queries in the most intuitive way possible and similarly to how you would write normal SQL, using templates embedded in your SQL text as comments. If you have been writing dynamic SQL using string concatenation, and got tired of counting single quotes, and frustrated over difficulties in proof-reading and troubleshooting, you're in the right place. Start by copy-pasting the below examples and you'll be on your way to dynamic SQL greatness!

## Installation
This is a pure-SQL solution so installation is as simple as it can be: Run each of the SQL scripts found under the /sql folder under your target database, and you're done!
